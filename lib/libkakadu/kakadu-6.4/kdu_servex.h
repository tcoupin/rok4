Description:
   Header file for the `kdu_servex' object which provides elementary
support for preparing raw code-streams and JP2/JPX files to be served by the
"kdu_server" application.  The implementation of `jpx_serve_target' is
designed to be platform independent, pushing all platform dependencies
into the "kdu_server" application itself, rather than its re-usable
components.

      open(const char *filename, int phld_threshold, int per_client_cache,
           FILE *cache_fp, bool cache_exists,
           kdu_long sub_start=0, kdu_long sub_lim=KDU_LONG_MAX);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Opens the target file, which must either be a JP2-compatible file
           or a raw JPEG2000 code-stream.  You may, optionally qualify the
           target file with a byte-range (a sub-range).  In this case, the
           raw code-stream or set of JP2-family boxes which make up the
           target are found at the `sub_start' position and
           `sub_lim'-`sub_start' is the maximum length of the target byte
           range.  Note, however, that the supplied byte range will be ignored
           if the structure of the target has already been cached in an
           existing cache file (see `cache_fp' and `cache_exists').
         [ARG: phld_threshold]
           This argument is used to control the way in which meta-data is
           partitioned into meta data-bins.  Specifically, any JP2 box whose
           total size exceeds the supplied `phld_threshold' is automatically
           replaced by a placeholder (`phld') box in the streaming
           representation.  The placeholder box references another data-bin
           which holds the contents of the box.  By selecting a small
           threshold, the meta-data may be split across numerous meta data-bins
           each of which will be delivered to the client only if it is
           relevant to the client's request.  Note, however, that this argument
           has no effect if the `cache_exists' argument is true, since then
           the partitioning of meta-data to data-bins has already taken place
           and the results have been stored in the `cache_fp' file.   It is
           important that the server use whatever partition was previously
           created so that the client will encounter a consistent
           representation each time it receives information from the
           file.
         [ARG: per_client_cache]
           This argument is used to control the size of the cache internally
           managed by each `kdu_codestream' object created by this function.
           Each time a `kdu_serve' object invokes `attach_to_codestream',
           the code-stream's maximum cache size is augmented by this amount
           (see `kdu_codestream::augment_cache_threshold').  Each time the
           `detach_from_codestream' function is invoked, the cache threshold
           is reduced by this amount.
         [ARG: cache_fp]
           If NULL, there will be no caching of the meta-data or stream
           identification structure created by this object, so no unique target
           identifier will be issued to the client.  Otherwise, this
           argument points to a file which is open either for reading or
           for writing.  If `cache_exists' is true, the file is open for
           reading and the meta-data and stream identification structure
           should be recovered by parsing the file's contents.  Otherwise,
           the file is open for writing; after generating the meta-data
           and stream identification structure, the object should save this
           structure to the supplied file for later re-use.  This ensures
           that the file will be presented in exactly the same way every
           time.  Cache files are associated by the "kdu_server" application
           with a unique target identifier.  Note that the present function
           will not close an open cache file.
        [ARG: cache_exists]
           True if a non-NULL `cache_fp' argument refers to a file which is
           open for reading.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT void close();
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           It is safe to call this function at any time, whether the object
           is open or not, but of course there should be no `kdu_serve' objects
           to which it is attached when you close it.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT void trim_resources();
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           The application should call this function whenever the number
           of threads which might be using this object decreases.
           This is because this the number of internal `kdu_event' objects
           created to facilitate efficient implementation of the
           `lock_codestreams' and `release_codestreams' functions may
           grow until it reaches the minimum of the number of threads
           concurrently trying to lock codestreams and the number of
           codestreams in the source.  When these synchronization objects
           are not in use, they are kept on a free list.  In an application
           where there are a large number of source processing threads
           and a large number of sources, the number of synchronization
           objects in the system may grow to reach the product of the
           number of source threads and sources (unlikely, but conceivable).
           To avoid this happening, and ensure that the number of
           synchronization objects does not grow beyond the total number
           of source threads, each source thread should call the present
           function when it stops using the source (typically when it is
           closing a client connection).
