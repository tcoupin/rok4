                identified via the `jp2_channels' object returned via
                `access_channels' are to be ignored.
           [>>] `MJ2_GRAPHICS_ALPHA' -> alpha blend with existing contents.
                The alpha channel is determined by invoking the
                `jp2_channels::get_opacity_mapping' function on the object
                returned via `access_channels'.
           [>>] `MJ2_GRAPHICS_PREMULT_ALPHA' -> alpha blend, where compressed
                data has already been blended with black.  The premultiplied

      get_geometry(double &presentation_width,
                   double &presentation_height,
                   double matrix[], bool for_movie=true);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function provides information regarding the geometric
           transformations which should be applied to the decompressed
           imagery associated with this track.  The `presentation_width'
           and `presentation_height' values represent conceptual dimensions
           to which the frame samples are to be scaled, so as to produce
           a presentation frame anchored at the origin.  This presentation
           frame is then subjected to affine transformation, using
           parameters described via the 9-element `matrix'.  The matrix
           is actually capable of representing perspective transformations,
           but is restricted to affine operations only by the
           Motion JPEG2000 standard.  The `for_movie' argument is used
           to select whether the geometric transformations described by
           this function should be those described in the track header
           alone (`for_movie'=false) or include also any additional
           transformations specified for the whole movie (`for_movie'=true).
         [ARG: presentation_width]
           Used to return a conceptual presentation width to which each
           frame is scaled prior to applying the `matrix'.  We say that this
           is "conceptual", because the effect of such scaling can always be
           folded into the matrix' itself, so it is unlikely that a good
           rendering implementation will actually scale first and then apply
           the affine transform.
         [ARG: presentation_height]
           Used to return a conceptual presentation height, to which each
           frame is scaled prior to applying the `matrix'.  The same
           considerations apply as those discussed for `presentation_width'.
         [ARG: matrix]
           3x3 matrix, stored in raster order as (a,c,x), (b,d,y), (u,v,w),
           where each point (p,q) on the surface of the presentation image
           is subjected to the following transformation:
           [>>] (m,n,z)^t = M * (p,q,1)^t  -- here, "^t" denotes transpose
                and M is the matrix whose rows are (a,c,x), (b,d,y) and
                (u,v,w).
           [//]
           The transformed point lies at x' = m/z and y'=n/z.  Although
           this matrix has the capability to represent a general perspective
           transformation of the frame, the Motion JPEG2000 standard
           insists that u=0, v=0 and w=1, so that z=1 and the transform
           is always affine.
         [ARG: for_movie]
           If false, the geomtric transformations described by this
           function are resticted to those identified in the track header.
           Otherwise, the geometric transformations include any additional
           matrix transformation described in the global movie header.

      get_cardinal_geometry(kdu_dims &pre_dims, bool &transpose,
                            bool &vflip, bool &hflip,
                            bool for_movie=true);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function plays a similar role to `get_geometry', except
           that the geometric transforms are approximated, if necessary, by
           ones which produce an image aligned with the cardinal (horizontal
           and vertical) axes.  In practice, there should be few if any
           movies for which this requires any kind of approximation.
           [//]
           To achieve the (approximated) geometric transformation, each
           original video frame should be scaled and offset, as required,
           to fit within the region represented by `pre_dims'.  The
           resulting frame, having these dimensions, should then be
           flipped and/or transposed according to the flags returned via
           `hflip', `vflip' and `transpose'.  Applying these flags to
           `pre_dims.to_apparent' will yield the dimensions and location
           of the frame, as it is to be presented on the rendered track
           or the complete rendered movie, depending on whether
           `for_movie' is false or true.
         [ARG: pre_dims]
           Used to return the location and dimensions of each frame after
           scaling and offsetting, prior to the application of the geometric
           transformation flags returned via `transpose', `vflip' and
           `hflip'.
         [ARG: transpose]
           Used to return the transpose flag.  If true, vertical
           coordinates should be exchanged with horizontal during rendering
           of the frame.
         [ARG: vflip]
           Used to return the vflip flag.  If true, the image should be
           vertically flipped during rendering.  If `transpose' and
           `vflip' are both true, the transpose operation should be
           applied first.
         [ARG: hflip]
           Used to return the hflip flag.  If true, the image should be
           horizontally flipped during rendering.  If `transpose' and
           `hflip' are both true, the transpose operation should be
           applied first.
         [ARG: for_movie]
           If false, the geomtric transformations described by this
           function are resticted to those identified in the track header.
           Otherwise, the geometric transformations include any additional
           matrix transformation described in the global movie header.

           make up a Motion JPEG2000 file are assigned unique indices
           starting from 0 by assigning the first N1 indices to the first
           track, the next N2 indices to the second track, and so forth,
           where N1 is the number of frames belonging to the track,
           multiplied by 1 (progressive) or 2 (interlaced) depending on
           the number of fields per frame for the track.
           [//]
           The function returns -1 if a unique codestream index cannot
           be assigned -- e.g., because the relevant frame or field does
           not exist.
           [//]
           If the ultimate data source is a dynamic cache, this function
           can also return -1 if insufficient information is currently
           available to deduce the absolute codestream index of
           the first codestream in the track.  However, this situation will
           certainly change after the first successful call to `open_stream'
           or `open_image'.
           [//]
           Note that the returned codestream index uniquely
           identifies the track, frame and field -- see
           `mj2_source::find_stream'.  However, it is
           possible that multiple tracks or frames share a single
           codestream.  In this case, the single resource will have
           different codestream indices, depending on the track and frame
           which use it.

           This function is provided to allow you to access multiple
           codestreams simultaneously.  Rather than opening the object's
           own internal `jp2_input_box' object, the function opens the
           supplied `input_box' at the start of the relevant codestream.
           You need not close this box before invoking the `seek_to_frame'
           function to advance to another frame.  You can open as many
           codestreams as you like in this way.  However, you may not invoke
           the present function while the internal `jp2_input_box' is
           open -- i.e., between calls to `open_image' and `close_image'.
           [//]
           The frame whose codestream is opened by this function is the
           one which would otherwise be used by the next call to `open_image'.
           However, neither the field nor the frame index are advanced by
           calling this function.  In order to open a different frame, you
           will generally use the `seek_to_frame' function first.  The
           particular field to be opened within the frame is identified by
           the `field_idx' argument, which may hold 0 or 1.  The
           interpretation of this argument is unaffected by any calls to
           `set_field_mode'.
         [RETURNS]
           The frame index associated with the opened codestream box,
           or -1 if the requested field does not exist or if the frame
           which would be accessed by the next call to `open_image' does
           not exist.
         [ARG: field_idx]
           0 for the first field in the frame; 1 for the second field in
           the frame.  Other values will result in a return value of -1.
           A value of 1 will also produce a return value of -1 if the
           video is not interlaced.
         [ARG: input_box]
           Pointer to a box which is not currently open.  Box is open upon
           return unless the function's return value is negative.
         [ARG: env]
           This argument is provided for multi-threading environments.  Since
           this particular function provides you with the opportunity to
           access multiple video frames concurrently, it is possible that
           I/O conflicts will occur where the frames are used by multiple
           threads.  Virtually all such conflicts are blocked by supplying
           a `kdu_thread_env' pointer to the relevant `kdu_codestream',
           `kdu_multi_synthesis' or other parsing, reading and rendering
           objects offered by Kakadu.  However, the simple action of opening
           the frame stream is not thread safe unless you also supply the
           `kdu_thread_env' object to this function here.

           This function opens an MJ2 compatible data source.  If the data

           It is illegal to invoke this function on an object which has

           [//]
           It is important to realize that reading from a Motion JPEG2000
           source generally requires seeking, so non-seekable `jp2_family_src'
           objects should not be used.
           [//]
           The current implementation of this object does not support dynamic
           caching data sources (those whose `jp2_family_src::uses_cache'
           function returns true).  However, all of the interface functions
           are designed to support sources for which the data in a cache might
           not yet be available.  This allows us to upgrade the internal
           implementation later without affecting the design of applications
           which use it.
         [RETURNS]
           Three possible values, as follows:
           [>>] 0 if insufficient information is available from the `src'
                object to complete the opening operation.  In practice,
                this can occur only if the `src' object is fueled by a
                dynamic cache (a `kdu_cache' object).
           [>>] 1 if successful.
           [>>] -1 if the data source does not advertise compatibility with
                the Motion JPEG2000 standard.  This value will not
                be returned unless `return_if_incompatible' is true.  If it
                is returned, the object will be left in the closed state.
         [ARG: src]
           A previously opened `jp2_family_src' object.  Note that you
           must explicitly close or destroy that object, once you are done
           using it.  The present object's `close' function will not do
           this for you.
