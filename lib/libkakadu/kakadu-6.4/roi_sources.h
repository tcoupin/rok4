Description:
   Defines two different types of source objects (both derived from
"kdu_roi_image") for supplying ROI mask information.  The first is perhaps
the simplest derivation of "kdu_roi_image" capable of doing anything useful:
it works with a single rectangular region.  The second is a much more
sophisticated region delivery engine, which uses an auxiliary image to
determine the foreground regions and automatically provides all of the
resampling required to map the geometry of the auxiliary image into that
of each image component.  This second object should be studied closely
by developers interested in delivering ROI encoded imagery from commercial
applications, since it should be easily adapted to work with other region
specification methods (e.g., interactive region specification by a
clinical specialist).

           Accepts a single rectangular region, specified relative to the
           high resolution code-stream canvas coordinate system.  This will
           be the foreground region associated with all ROI mask generation

           prevailing geometric transformations, which may have been set

           would correspond exactly to the full image region on the canvas.

        This object actually managed ROI information for a full vertical

     the location and dimensions of the set of all tiles in the component
     which have the same horizontal tile index, while `rows_left_in_tile'
     indicates the number of rows left in the current tile.  Only one of the
     vertically adjacent tiles may be accessed at a time through the base
     `kdu_roi_node' interface.  The `release' function must be called before
     a subsequent tile in the stripe can be acquired through
     `kdu_roi_graphics_image::acquire'.
        The `first_line' and `last_line' members point to the first and last
     element in a linked list of repeatable line buffers.  Each line buffer
     has a `repeat_factor' indicating the number of `pull' calls which should
     return the same line.  Once the `repeat_factor' reaches 0, the line
     is recycled via a `free_lines' heap. */

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Accepts the name of a monochrome image file and a single
           threshold.  The image represented by this file is stretched
           (interpolated) or shrunk (decimated) to match the geometry
           of the actual image being compressed (as represented by the
           `codestream') and its sample values are thresholded.  Locations
           where the threshold is exceeded are deemed to belong to the
           foreground, while the remainder is interpreted as background.
           [//]
           Note that the mask image (the one being thresholded) is read
           incrementally, buffering the smallest amount of data required
           to satisfy the demand for ROI information, which filters
           through from the leaves of the compression tree (`kdu_encoder'
           objects) all the way up through the DWT analysis system.
         [ARG: codestream]
           Master interface to the internal code-stream management
           machinery associated with the image being compressed.
         [ARG: fname]
           Name of the mask image, to be opened and used to determine the
           foreground region.  Currently, only binary PGM files are
           accepted, although it would be trivial to add support for other
           file formats.  Note that the dimensions of the mask image are
           arbitrary.  The width and the height are independently stretched
           to the dimensions of the image which is actually being compressed.
         [ARG: threshold]
           Foreground threshold, expressed as a normalized quantity in the
           range 0 to 1, where 0 means black and 1 means white.  Foreground
           locations must have sample values which strictly exceed the
           threshold, meaning that a threshold of 0 will produce foreground
           everywhere the mask image's samples are non-zero, while a
           threshold of 1 will produce an empty foreground.
