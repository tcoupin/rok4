class kds_id_encoder {
  /* [SYNOPSIS]
     This object provides the functionality required to encode all
     information in a JPIP message header which is required to uniquely
     identify the data-bin to which the message refers.  A specific instance
     of this object may be passed to `kdu_serve::initialize', after which
     `kdu_serve::generate_increments' will use these encoding rules to
     generate messages with correctly encoded headers.
     [//]
     The default implementation encodes data-bin identifiers using a variable
     number of bytes following the conventions of the JPIP standard
     (JPEG2000, Part 9, or IS 15444-9).  To understand these rules, one
     must first appreciate the concept of a VBAS (Variable length Byte Aligned
     Segment).  A VBAS is a string of bytes, all but the last of which has
     a most significant bit of 1.  The least significant 7 bits from each
     of these bytes are concatenated in order to form a 7K bit code, where
     K is the number of bytes in the VBAS.  A JPIP message header has the
     form:
     [>>] Bin-ID [, Class] [, CSn], Offset, Length [, Aux]
     [//]
     where each of the 6 items is a VBAS and those items enclosed in square
     brackets might not always appear.  The present object's `encode_id'
     function is used to encode the first 3 elements listed above.  The
     Bin-ID is always encoded, and the most significant 2 bits of its
     7K bit code identify whether or not each of the Class and CSn elements
     appear.
     [//]
     In addition to providing the `encode_id' function, the default
     implementation also remembers the class code and stream-id values of
     the most recently encoded message, so that the differential header
     encoding rules specified in the JPIP standard can be exploited for
     efficiency.  The `kdu_serve::generate_increments' function
     calls the `decouple' member at appropriate points so as to ensure
     that the differential encoding rules are not applied across
     boundaries at which the message stream may be broken.
     [//]
     Note that the default implementation described above may be
     altered by overriding the `encode_id' or other member functions of the
     default implementation in an object supplied to
     `kdu_serve::generate_increments'.

    virtual void decouple() { exploit_last_message=false; }
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           After this function is called, the next data-bin ID to be encoded
           by the `encode_id' function will be entirely independent of all
           previous headers.  Otherwise, the header may be coded differentially
           with respect to previous headers.  This function is invoked
           automatically, at the start of each call to
           `kdu_serve::generate_increments', which ensures at least that the
           data generated from that call can be decoded unambiguously without
           reference to the information produced by other calls to
           `kdu_serve::generate_increments', possibly with a different
           window context (the `kdu_serve' object can manage multiple
           concurrent window contexts).  The `decouple' function may be
           called more frequently, as explained in connection with the
           `decouple_chunks' argument to `kdu_serve::generate_increments'.

      encode_id(kdu_byte *dest, int databin_class, int stream_id,

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Encodes the indicated data-bin identifier for the indicated
           data-bin class into a whole number of bytes which are recorded in
           the `dest' buffer.  If `dest' is NULL, the function only simulates
           the process, returning the total number of bytes which would have
           been written.  Since the ID encoding rules can be state
           dependent (as in JPIP), we note that simulation does not have
           any impact on state, so the results might only be valid when
           simulating the encoding of a data-bin ID for the first message
           following a fully encoded message.
         [RETURNS]
           The actual number of bytes occupied by the data-bin identifier
           written to the `dest' array.  This number of bytes includes the
           number of bytes required to represent the databin class, the
           codestream-id value, and the value of the `is_final' flag.  It
           does not include the cost of encoding auxiliary information
           associated with `extended' headers.
         [ARG: databin_class]
           Currently one of `KDU_MAIN_HEADER_DATABIN',
           `KDU_TILE_HEADER_DATABIN', `KDU_PRECINCT_DATABIN',
           `KDU_TILE_DATABIN' or `KDU_META_DATABIN', although new classes
           might be created in the future.
         [ARG: stream_id]
           Identifier of the code-stream to which the data-bin belongs.  Must
           be non-negative.  As a general rule, use 0 unless the target object
           you are transporting has multiple code-streams to distinguish.
         [ARG: bin_id]
           See the description of `kdu_serve::generate_increments' for a
           discussion of the identifiers which can be supplied for each
           data-bin class.
         [ARG: is_final]
           If true, the data-bin identifier is being used to signal the
           final contribution to that data-bin.  This fact must be encoded
           into the identifier itself, at least for message headers defined
           by the JPIP standard.
         [ARG: extended]
           If true, this message header has an extended form.  For the JPIP
           standard, this means that an extra VBAS (see general introduction
           to the present `kds_id_encoder' object) appears at the end of the
           header.  The extended VBAS is not encoded by this function, but
           the class code will be adjusted to reflect the presence of the
           extended VBAS if this flag is set to true.  The general policy,
           at least for JPIP, is that extended message headers contain
           additional information which is not strictly required for correct
           interpretation of the message contents, but may be useful to
           some clients.

           This word may contain any meaningful combination of the following

           [>>] `KDS_METASCOPE_MANDATORY' -- If this flag is present and the
                metadata otherwise matches the current client request, the
                metadata must be sent to the client, regardless of whether
                or not a "metareq" request field has been used.
           [>>] `KDS_METASCOPE_IMAGE_MANDATORY' -- Similar to the above flag,
                except the matching metadata ceases to be mandatory if a
                "metareq" request field specifies "metadata-only".  Imagery
                related headers generally belong to this category
           [>>] `KDS_METASCOPE_INCLUDE_NEXT_SIBLING' -- If this flag is
                present, whenever the present group is considered relevant
                to a client request, all box headers in the next sibling
                group (boxes inside the same superbox), if any, must also be
                considered relevant to the client request.  When applied
                to a group of top-level boxes, this means that the next
                group of top-level box headers must also be sent to the client.
                The flag plays an important role in ensuring that a file
                format reader will be able to determine whether or not
                all necessary boxes have been received within certain
                scopes.  For example, within a JPX compositing layer header
                box, all immediate sub-boxes must be seen in order for a
                reader to determine whether or not any other relevant boxes
                might be left to receive, which might override defaults
                in a JP2 header box.
           [>>] `KDS_METASCOPE_LEAF' -- If this flag is present, the
                following flags (all commencing with the `HAS_' prefix) may
                be interpreted as final qualifiers, meaning that the metagroup
                and all of its sub-groups must be sent to the client so long
                as the client request matches this scope.  Otherwise, a
                scope match simply means that one of the sub-groups might
                have a scope match.
           [>>] `KDS_METASCOPE_HAS_GLOBAL_DATA' -- If present, either this
                metagroup or one of its descendants (via placeholders) holds
                global metadata, not associated with any particular image
                entity.  Note that this is not mutually exclusive with the
                following flag, since a metagroup may have multiple sub-groups,
                only some of which are global.
           [>>] `KDS_METASCOPE_HAS_IMAGE_SPECIFIC_DATA' -- If present,
                either this metagroup or one of its descendants (via
                placeholders) holds metadata which is associated with one
                or more specific image entities (codestreams or compositing
                layers).  In this case, the `entities' member must be
                inspected to determine the identities of these image
                entities.
           [>>] `KDS_METASCOPE_HAS_IMAGE_WIDE_DATA' -- This flag may be
                present only if `KDS_METASCOPE_HAS_IMAGE_SPECIFIC_DATA'
                is also present.  It indicates that this group, or one of
                its descendants (via placeholders), is associated with the

                sub-box is an ROI description box, or that it is descended
                from a group of this form.  The difference between this
                condition and `KDS_METASCOPE_HAS_REGION_SPECIFIC_DATA' is
                that the latter applies also to ancestors of boxes which

                associated with one or more codestream contexts, rather than
                just with codestreams.  For a JPX source, this flag is set
                to true if the group contains a `nlst' box whose contents
                include at least one compositing layer index, regardless of
                whether codestream indices are included as well.  If this is
                true, all of the group's descendants will have the same flag
                set and any containing `asoc' box group which has the
                `nlst' as its first sub-box will also have the flag set.

           cannot exceed 2^32, log_2(region-area) <= 64, so the `sequence'
           value should always be positive and need never be very large.

  /* [SYNOPSIS]
       This object plays a critical role in the implementation of any
       JPIP server which is able to support intelligent delivery of
       metadata together with imagery to its clients.  It is used to
       build a tree-structured manifest of the metadata which is available,
       together with pre-digested information concerning the relevance
       of that metadata to particular image code-streams, or specific
       regions components or resolutions of those code-streams.
       [//]
       The metadata tree need not contain an entry for every single metadata
       box from the original JP2-family file.  Instead, the granularity of the
       representation may be selected by the `kdu_serve_target' object
       which creates and owns the tree.
       [//]
       The elements of each metadata-bin are represented by a list of
       `kds_metagroup' objects, connected via their `next' members.  Each
       element in this list represents one or more boxes (all JP2-family
       files are built from boxes) at the top level of the contents of
       that data-bin.  The tree starts at metadata-bin 0, whose top-level
       boxes are the top-level boxes of the original JP2-family file.
       [//]
       Amongst the list of `kds_metagroup' objects which represent the
       contents of a metadata-bin, there may be one or more placeholder
       boxes.  Placeholders have a rich and powerful structure, as
       described in the JPIP standard (to become IS 15444-9).  In this
       case, the `phld' member of the `kds_metagroup' structure will
       point to another list of `kds_metagroup' objects, representing
       the data-bin to which the placeholder refers.  The `phld_bin_id'
       member provides the corresponding metadata-bin identifier.

           the `box_types' array, whether a sub-box or not.  If the client
           asks only for headers of a box in this group, the server will only
           be able to avoid sending the body of the last box in the group.

           If the box contains a placeholder, `last_box_header_prefix' must be

           if `layer_lengths' is non-NULL, `num_layer_lengths' on entry holds
           the size of the array.  In any case, upon return the values of
           `num_layer_slopes' and `num_layer_lengths' hold the number of
           quality layers for which rate-distortion slope thresholds are
           available and the number of quality layers for which compressed
           lengths are available, respectively.  Either or both of these
           values may be 0.
           [//]
           The quantities returned via the `layer_log_slopes' array
           represent 256*(256-64+log_2(S_L)) where S_L is the
           distortion-length slope threshold for quality layer L, measured as
           the ratio between the reduction in total squared error distortion
           (with samples normalized to the range 0 to 1.0) and the increase
           in code length (measured in bytes).  These values are guaranteed
           to lie in the interval 0 to 65535, even if they are returned as
           integers.
         [RETURNS]
           False if the codestream does not exist or if no R-D information
           is available for it.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to gain access to one of the target object's
           code-streams.  The function will return an empty interface (one
           whose `kdu_codestream::exists' function returns false) if
           `codestream_id' refers to a code-stream which is to be served as
           a raw metadata box, or if `codestream_id' does not belong to any
           of the ranges returned via `get_codestream_ranges'.
           [//]
           Otherwise, the returned object provides an interface to an open
           `kdu_codestream', created for reading.
           [//]
           Note carefully, that you should not actually use the code-stream
           interface without first locking it with the `lock_codestreams'
           function.  This is because multiple `kdu_serve' objects running
           in different threads of execution might be attempting to access
           the object simultaneously.
           [//]
           Note also that the `kdu_codestream' machinery should have been
           configured internally to operate in the `persistent' mode.
        [ARG: thread_handle]
           You must supply a physical address which is unique to the
           present thread of execution; this will normally be the `kd_serve'
           object embedded inside a `kdu_serve' interface, so we declare
           the address as being a pointer to `kd_serve' to as to encourage
           compiler checking for consistency.  However, the object is never
           actually inspected; only its address is used.
           [//]
           The `thread_handle' is used to keep track of who has acquired a
           lock on the code-stream, enabling the lock to be released in the
           event that the owner detaches from the code-stream without first
           releasing the lock.  This can happen if an error condition caused
           an exception in the owner of the lock.

           This is one of four functions which work together to translate

           relative to a codestream context into view windows expressed
           relative to the individual codestreams associated with those
           contexts.  A codestream context might be a JPX compositing layer
           or an MJ2 video track, for instance.  The context is generally
           a higher level imagery object which may be represented by one
           or more codestreams.  The context is identified by the
           `context_type' and `context_idx' arguments, but may also be
           modified by the `remapping_ids' array, as explained below.

           identifiers (in "kdu_client_window.h") are
           `KDU_JPIP_CONTEXT_JPXL' (for JPX compositing layer contexts) and
           `KDU_JPIP_CONTEXT_MJ2T' (for MJ2 video tracks).  For more
           information on these, see `kdu_sampled_range::context_type'.
         [ARG: context_idx]
           Identifies the specific index of the JPX compositing layer,
           MJ2 video track or other context.  Note that JPX compositing
           layers are numbered from 0, while MJ2 video track numbers start
           from 1.
         [ARG: remapping_ids]
           Array containing two integers, whose values may alter the

class kdu_serve {
  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       Provides the platform independent component of a powerful and
       flexible JPIP server system.  This object provides support for
       cache modeling and the ability to handle multiple window contexts
       concurrently.  Within each window context, new window requests are
       posed by calls to `set_window', data is generated by calls to
       `generate_increments', and the current state of the window request
       may be queried by calls to `get_window'.  The object also provides
       support for the definition of per-context preferences, via calls to
       `set_window_prefs', which may affect the way in which responses are
       generated.
       [//]
       The object updates its internal cache model (which spans all window
       contexts), whenever data is generated by calls to `generate_increments'.
       However, the object is also fully capable of processing all JPIP
       cache model manipulation statements in the most efficient way, delaying
       the cache model updates until convenient while ensuring synchronization
       of the cache model.  The object is also fully capable of handling
       lost data, adjusting its cache model in accordance with information
       provided by the application about lost data chunks.
       [//]
       Many of these features are new to Kakadu version 6.4.  Moreover, from
       version 6.4, the object is able to handle very large windows of
       interest, spanning any spatial region, across any number of codestreams,
       sequencing content in a manner which at least partially preserves
       the progressive quality experience while minimizing access to
       resources.  The logic for this is quite intricate and extensive, yet
       invisible to the application.  The object manages cache models,
       interchange codestreams and open codestream interfaces into the
       ultimate `kdu_serve_target' through a multi-level caching strategy
       which keeps only a very small working set of codesteams active at any
       given time and can potentially discard portions of its cache model
       if it becomes unwieldly.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           The real construction takes place here -- somewhat safer, since
           we prefer to avoid having exceptions thrown from within the
           constructor itself.  The function configures the server to work
           with the existing `kdu_serve_target' object, which should have
           already been created and configured as necessary.
           [//]
           A single `target' may be shared between multiple 'kdu_serve'
           objects, although `kdu_serve_target::lock_codestreams' and
           `kdu_serve_target::release_codestreams' may need to implement
           appropriate synchronization mechanisms if the `kdu_serve'
           objects are to operate in different threads of execution.
           In general, it is important that all other users of the `target'
           object close their open tiles while calls to the present function
           (`initialize') and the `generate_increments' function are in
           progress.
           [//]
           Once the `kdu_serve' object has been initialized, the application
           should call the `set_window' function to identify the image
           code-streams, image components, resolution, spatial region, etc.,
           which are of interest.  The application then issues one or more
           calls to `generate_increments', letting `kdu_serve' itself decide
           what compressed data and metadata increments should be assembled
           (usually, on behalf of an interactive client).  In interactive
           client-server applications, the serving application will also
           listen for changes in the client's window of interest, issuing new
           calls to `set_window', as appropriate.  This affects the present
           object's decisions as to what compressed data should actually be
           packaged up in response to subsequent calls to
           `generate_increments'.
         [ARG: max_chunk_size]
           This argument determines the maximum size of the data chunks into
           which the `generate_increments' function packs compressed data.
           This size includes any prefix which the application reserves in
           its calls to `generate_increments'.
         [ARG: chunk_prefix_bytes]
           Indicates the number of bytes which should be reserved at the
           beginning of each data chunk, for application use.  This value will
           be written into the `kds_chunk::prefix_bytes' member of each
           chunk in the list returned by `generate_increments'.
         [ARG: ignore_relevance_info]
           If this argument is true, the object will serve all relevant
           precinct data layer by layer, with the lowest resolution subbands
           appearing before the higher resolution subbands, within each layer.
           This is the behaviour offered by previous implementations of the
           object.  On the other hand, if this argument is false, the
           function will process the precincts in order of their relevance
           (percentage overlap with the region of interest).  Moreover, if
           information is available concerning the rate-distortion slope
           thresholds associated with the code-stream quality layers, this
           information is used in conjunction with the relevance factors to
           re-sequence the original code-stream packets, in a manner which
           is expected to reduce the distortion within the window of interest
           as quickly as possible.  This often means that lower resolution
           precincts and precincts with relatively little overlap with the
           window tend to get sequenced later (sometimes several layers later)
           than they otherwise would.
         [ARG: custom_id_encoder]
           This argument allows you specify a custom instance of the
           `kds_id_encoder' class (or a derived version of that class) to
           implement your own message header encoding rules.  In most cases,
           you will leave this argument NULL, so that the default
           JPIP-compliant header encoding is used.  If you do supply your
           own `custom_id_encoder', it is your responsibility to explicitly
           destroy it (if required), but not until you have completely
           finished using the present object.  You may not change ID
           encoding objects within a single instantiation of `kdu_serve'.
           This is deliberate, because some bounds on message header lengths
           need to be computed and cached internally for efficiency reasons.

                 bool is_stateless=false, int context_id=0);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to specify the `window' of interest for a given
           window context (as given by `context_id'), along with any
           cache model manipulation instructions, which may be accompany the
           window.
           [//]
           Like most functions offered by the `kdu_serve' object, the
           call affects only one specific window context, as identified by
           the `context_id'.  Each time this function is invoked with a
           `context_id' which differs from any of those currently in use,
           a new window context is automatically created.
           [//]
           Window contexts are never actually destroyed, so you should be
           careful about the way in which you choose to generate `context_id'
           values.  A recommended procedure is to choose `context_id' in the
           range 0 to N-1 where N is the maximum number of concurrent window
           contexts you plan to support.  Fortunately, once a window context
           has become idle (all data generated for the most recent request and
           no outstanding data chunks left), its resource consumption
           is automatically reduced to an almost negligible level.  You can,
           of course, encourage this to happen as soon as possible by invoking
           the present function with an empty `window'.
           [//]
           It is important to note that the function may need to modify
           some of the window parameters in order to satisfy internal
           resource constraint (or answer implicit questions which are
           posed by some of the request parameters).  Moreover, the way
           in which this happens may depend upon the current window handling
           preferences -- see `pref_updates'.  The `get_window'
           function may be used to determine the actual window parameters
           which are being used at any given point, since the `window'
           argument supplied here is not itself modified.
           [//]
           Although this function may be called as often as needed, there
           is a computational overhead associated with changes in the window
           of interest.  The next time `generate_increments' is called, it
           will have to build a new list of active precincts, which might
           easily take a milisecond or more.  Perhaps even more importantly,
           code-block data for the new precincts may need to be loaded from
           `kdu_codestream' objects accessed via
           `kdu_serve_target::access_codestream'.  This may indirectly trigger
           disk accesses, packet parsing and cache management activities.
           For this reason, once you have committed to calling
           `generate_increments' in response to some new window, you should
           aim to generate a significant amount of data for that window before
           moving on to a new one.  The actual minimum amount of data which
           the application chooses to generate for one window before moving to
           another might (ideally) be based upon simultaneous estimates of the
           computational complexity and the communication bandwidth to a
           remote client.
           [//]
           An important aspect of this function is the way in which
           cache model manipulation instructions are handled, as supplied via
           the `model_instructions' argument.  If `model_instructions' is
           non-NULL, the `model_instructions->is_stateless' function must
           return the same value as the `is_stateless' argument supplied here.
           In any case, the cache model instructions are copied internally
           and processed incrementally only on-demand.  This is by far the
           most efficient thing to do; however, to preserve the appearance
           of instantaneous application of all cache model instructions, in
           the event that a new call to `set_window' arrives for the
           current window context or a different window context, the internal
           machinery must either apply all outstanding model instructions
           immediately or, if appropriate, prepend them to the model
           instructions (if any) associated with the new request.  In any
           event, the impact of these various considerations is that you
           cannot rely upon the return value produced by `get_image_done'
           until outstanding calls to `generate_increments' have completed.
         [ARG: window]
           The interpretation of this object and its members is carefully
           described in the comments accompanying the `kdu_window'
           object.
         [ARG: pref_updates]
           If non-NULL, this argument provides (possibly) additional
           information concerning user preferences.  Except in the stateless
           mode, preferences are persistent, so passing a NULL or empty object
           in here will leave the current preferences in place.  More
           generally, only those "related-pref-sets" for which information
           is provided in the `pref_updates' object are actually updated --
           this is done using the `kdu_window_prefs::update' function, where
           you may find additional information concerning "related-pref-sets".
         [ARG: model_instructions]
           For a description of cache model instructions and their
           interpretation, see the definition of `kdu_window_model'.  What
           you need to know here is that the contents of any non-NULL
           `model_instructions' object are copied internally, so you do not
           need to preserve the object beyond this call.  You should also
           be aware that cache model instructions are actually processed
           on-demand, although this should be transparent to the application,
           because any new window requests (for this or another window
           context), which may depend upon the state of the internal cache
           model, will either trigger the application of any outstanding model
           instructions, or else prepend the outstanding cache model
           instructions to those associated with the new request.
           [//]
           For the purpose of determining cache consistency points, where
           multiple window contexts are involved, you can assume that cache
           model instructions are effectively applied at the point when
           `generate_increments' is first called, since the cache model
           instructions were supplied via this function.  Even
           though the instructions might not be applied until later, this
           will only happen where it does not interfere with the
           cache consistency associated with the above assumption.
           [//]
           What all this means is that a JPIP server application should not
           provide a reply to a client until it has invoked
           `generate_increments'.  Moreover, a client which needs to be
           sure that cache model instructions sent to one JPIP channel
           will affect the response to a request on a second JPIP channel
           should wait until the response headers are received for the
           first channel's request before sending the second channel's
           request.
         [ARG: is_stateless]
           If true, the internal cache model contents are effectively
           discarded prior to and following the generation of all data-bin
           increments (may require multiple calls to `generate_increments')
           for this window of interest.  In stateless mode, `context_id' must
           be 0.  Moreover, the entire `kdu_serve' object must be used in
           such a way that all calls to `set_window' have the same value for
           the `is_stateless' argument -- an error will be generated through
           `kdu_error' if this is not the case.
         [ARG: context_id]
           See discussion of window contexts and identifiers in the opening
           paragraphs of this function's documentation.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool
      get_window(kdu_window &window, int context_id=0) const;
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Retrieves the window parameters which are to be used in the next
           call to `generate_increments' unless `set_window' is called first.
           As with most functions offered by `kdu_serve', this call relates
           to a specific window context, as identified by `context_id'.
           [//]
           The principle reason for calling this function is to learn about
           any modifications which the server made to the window parameters
           supplied in a previous call to `set_window'.  As noted in
           connection with that function, the server may need to make such
           changes in order to satisfy its own resource constraints.  In
           particular, very large windows (large spatial regions and/or
           large number of components) may require excessive memory to be
           allocated by the server.
           [//]
           It is important to realize that the server may not make any
           necessary alterations to the window parameters supplied to
           `set_window' until after the first subsequent call to
           `generate_increments'.  Thus, the most meaningful point at which
           to call the present function is after the first (or a subsequent)
           call to `generate_increments' which follows a `set_window' call.
         [RETURNS]
           True if the window is still active, in the sense that not all
           data which is relevant to the window has yet been packaged up
           in calls to `generate_increments'.  If the function returns
           false, subsequent calls to `generate_increments' are guaranteed
           to return NULL, meaning that the window has been fully served.
         [ARG: context_id]
           As explained in connection with `set_window', this object is
           capable of managing multiple concurrent window contexts.  If
           no context with the indicated `context_id' has yet been used, the
           present function invokes `window.init' and returns false without
           creating a new window context.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool get_image_done() const;
      /* [SYNTHESIS]
           Call this function to determine whether the entire target
           has been packaged up through calls to the `generate_increments'
           function.  In some cases, the target may contain a massive number
           of data-bins, potentially arising from a massive number of
           separate codestreams.  The internal object goes to some effort to
           keep track of the completion of targets, even in such cases, but
           it may happen that the internal cache model must be trimmed back
           to avoid excessive resource consumption, in which case the function
           could return false even if all content has in fact been delivered.
           In any event, calling this function is very inexpensive, so you
           can feel free to call it frequently if desired.
           [//]
           It should be noted that the object bases its information upon
           an internal cache model, which reflects the contents of a
           client cache which is presumed to have been instantaneously
           filled with all data packaged up by `generate_increments'.  The
           cache model is also affected by the instructions contained in
           `kdu_window_model' objects passed to `set_window', which may not
           be fully processed until the corresponding call(s) to
           `generate_increments' return NULL.
           [//]
           When operating in the stateless mode (i.e., when calls to
           `set_window' have the `is_stateless' argument set to true), this
           function can be counted upon to return true if the last call to
           `generate_increments' completed the dispatch of all content in
           the entire target within the span of that single request -- i.e.,
           without any intervening calls to `set_window'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function may be used by server applications to insert
           additional data into the list of chunks which are served by
           the object's `generate_increments' function.  As with
           most functions offered by the object, the `context_id' argument
           identifies a specific window context with which the extra
           data is to be associated.
           [//]
           The object maintains an internal queue of outstanding data for each
           window context; this data must be delivered prior to any further
           data-bin increments when `generate_increments' is invoked with the
           same `context_id'; when this happens, `generate_increments' first
           pulls data from the head of this outstanding data queue; only once
           it is empty, can data-bin increments be generated and included in
           the list of data chunks which it returns.  Calling the present
           function augments this internal outstanding data queue.
           [//]
           If the `chunk_list' argument is non-NULL, the function behaves
           slightly differently, appending the data to the existing list of
           `kds_chunk' buffers, all of which were previously returned by
           one or more calls to `generate_increments', and augmenting this
           list as necessary.  In this case, the data is not added to the
           internal queue of outstanding data and the `context_id' argument
           is ignored.
           [//]
           The extra data supplied to this function is always written as
           a single contiguous block, which must be contained in a single
           data chunk. If the data cannot be appended to an existing chunk
           without overflowing, a new chunk is created.  If the data is too
           long to fit in a single chunk at all, the function generates an
           error through `kdu_error'.  Of course, this is undesirable, so
           you should make sure the amount of data you supply does not exceed
           the maximum chunk length, minus the chunk prefix size, as supplied
           to the present object's constructor.
           [//]
           You can use the `retrieve_extra_data_chunks' function to
           retrieve a list of chunks holding the extra data pushed in
           by this function, all by itself, as an alternative to calling
           `generate_increments'.  Whether by this means or by subsequent
           calls to `generate_increments', once extra data has been cleared
           from the relevant window context, subsequent calls to
           `push_extra_data' start assembling extra data from scratch.
         [RETURNS]
           The number of bytes which are still available within the relevant
           window context, for storing extra data bytes, before the chunk
           becomes full.  If `num_bytes' is 0, the function does nothing
           except return the number of bytes which are available.  If
           `chunk_list' is non-NULL, the function returns the number of bytes
           which remain within the last chunk on the list headed by
           `chunk_list' to which extra data has been written.  If no extra
           data has yet been written to this list, by this or previous calls
           to the function, the return value will indicate the capacity of a
           completely new data chunk which would be created if extra data
           were to be written to the list.
         [ARG: data]

           context's internal extra data queue, for inclusion in the
           chunk list returned by a subsequent call to `generate_increments'.

           This function returns a linked list of `kds_chunk' objects,
           representing new elements of the JPEG2000 compressed imagery
           or metadata which is relevant to the window most recently
           passed to `set_window'.  The chunks contain one or more whole
           JPIP messages, each of which represents a byte range from one
           such element.  Possible elements are metadata-bins, precinct
           data-bins, code-stream main header data-bins and tile header
           data-bins.  The object does not currently support delivery of
           tile data-bins, which offer substantially less flexibility.
           It is possible that some messages which have previously been
           generated by this function will overlap with the new messages,
           resulting in redundant transmission by the server application.
           This may happen if the `truncate_cache_model' function is used
           to clear the server's memory of information it may previously
           have generated.

           Server applications typically call this function repeatedly,

           to be contained in the returned chunks.  As of Kakadu v6.2, the
           `suggested_message_bytes' limit includes the length of message
           headers as well as message body data contained in the returned
           list of `kds_chunk' objects.  Messages and their headers are
           described by the JPIP standard (currently committee draft,
           but will become IS 15444-9).
           [//]
           Applications will ideally select `suggested_message_bytes' on the
           basis of their current estimates regarding the communication
           bandwidth.  If the application attempts to transfer too much data
           from the current window to a remote client, the client's window of
           interest may change before the data can be transmitted.  On the
           other hand, each call to this function can be quite expensive, so
           servers will not want to call `generate_increments' more frequently
           than necessary.  Ideally, the function is called only once, between
           changes in the client's window of interest, but changes in the
           client's interests are not generally predictable in an interactive
           application.
           [//]
           Prior to return, the `kdu_serve' object updates its internal cache
           model, based on the assumption that all of the chunks will be
           successfully transmitted to a client which inserts all relevant
           data into its cache.  In some cases, the application may opt not
           to send some or all of the chunks to a client.  For example,
           if a remote user changes his/her window of interest dramatically
           before all outstanding chunks have been transmitted, the server
           application may choose to abandon some of the chunks.  This is
           acceptable, so long as the application informs the `kdu_serve'
           object that it has abandoned these chunks.  This may be done by
           asserting `check_abandoned'=true in the call to `release_chunks'.
           In this case, the application is expected to have marked all
           of the chunks which were reliably transmitted by setting their
           `abandoned' fields to false.
           [//]
           If the application has used the `push_extra_data' function to
           push extra data onto the internal extra data queue (as opposed
           to pushing it onto the end of a list of chunks returned by this
           function), the extra data will be included in the first chunk
           returned by this function, until there is no extra data left.
         [RETURNS]
           The function will NEVER return a NULL pointer.  If there is no
           data available, the function may return a single chunk, which
           contains no data at all.  This ensures that there is always
           a non-empty list of data chunks which can be passed to the
           `push_extra_data' function, if required.
         [ARG: suggested_message_bytes]
           Suggested number of bytes in the messages from which the returned
           chunks are composed.  Each chunk is a concatenated list of
           messages, each containing a header, followed by a body, which
           consists of a byte range from a single data-bin (precinct,
           code-stream header or metadata-bin).  As of Kakadu v6.2,
           the message headers are included in the limit represented by
           `suggested_message_bytes' or `max_message_bytes'.  The
           `suggested_message_bytes' limit is not interpreted strictly;
           instead, the function tries to include whole packets from as many
           relevant precinct data-bins as possible, until the suggested
           limit is exceeded.  It may thus be exceeded by a considerable
           margin if packets are very large.
         [ARG: max_message_bytes]
           This argument provides a strict limit on the number of bytes
           which can be included in the messages in the returned
           chunk list, not including any extra data which was pushed in via
           the `push_extra_data' function.  The limit will not be exceeded
           under any conditions.  This means that partial packets may be
           included from the final precinct data-bin which contributes to
           the chunk list.  Upon return, the value of this variable is
           decremented by the actual number of message bytes, allowing
           the caller to keep track of the number of bytes which can be
           generated in a subsequent call to the function, unless the limit
           has changed.  Note that the function may return a non-NULL
           result, even if the `max_message_bytes' argument holds 0 on entry.
           [//]
           Prior to Kakadu v6.2, this argument provided a limit only for the
           number of bytes in message bodies.  This was the most appropriate
           policy for implementing JPIP as of the final Working Draft of the
           standard; counting only message bodies also had a number of
           beneficial attributes, such as the ability to guarantee that the
           limit can be met precisely.  Unfortunately, a sentence in the
           description of the JPIP "len" request field was dropped from the
           final text of the standard some time ago, and this went unnoticed
           for several years.  As a result, Kakadu has changed to follow
           suit.  However, it is now possible (actually extremely likely)
           that responses which are truncated to satisfy the
           `max_message_bytes' limit will fall somewhat short of the limit.
           To avoid the inefficiencies created by further calls to this
           function when `max_message_bytes' is left close to, but not exactly
           equal to zero, this function sets `max_message_bytes' to 0 if the
           response which has been generated was limited by the
           `max_message_bytes' limit.
         [ARG: align]
           If true, each message generated by this function which crosses
           a precinct packet boundary will finish at a subsequent packet
           boundary.  The option has no effect on messages which correspond
           to data-bins other than precinct data-bins.
         [ARG: use_extended_message_headers]
           If true, each message which corresponds to a precinct data-bin
           will use the extended header format, which includes an
           indication of the number of complete quality layers represented
           by the message together with all bytes from the precinct which
           precede those in the message.
         [ARG: decouple_chunks]
           If true (this is a reasonable default), the first message written
           to each chunk will have its header coded in a manner which does
           not rely on successful delivery of messages in other chunks.
           Specifically, in this case the `kds_id_encoder::decouple' function
           will be called prior to writing each new chunk.  For applications
           in which the messages are delivered over a reliable stream oriented
           connection, it may be sufficient to decouple the message header
           coding less frequently, with some small efficiency savings.  In
           any case, the `kds_id_encoder::decouple' function will be
           invoked at the start of each call to `generate_increments' so
           that the sequences of messages generated by each such call can be
           decoded independently.  This is particularly important if multiple
           concurrent window contexts are used (i.e., this function is called
           with different `context_id' values).
         [ARG: context_id]
           Associates calls to this function with the relevant window of
           interest, as set by the last call to `set_window' which had the
           same `context_id'.  If there was no such call, the present
           function returns NULL immediately without creating an internal
           window context.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT void
      release_chunks(kds_chunk *chunks, bool check_abandoned=false);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Recycles the resources returned by `generate_increments'.  The
           `check_abandoned' argument is provided for the benefit of
           advanced server applications which may decide to abandon some
           of the data chunks which have not yet been transmitted to a
           remote client.  Abandonment means that the application will not
           transmit these chunks or that it has transmitted them, but is
           not certain whether or not they have been or ever will be
           received correctly, and is not prepared to wait to find out.
           The decision to abandon data chunks may be made in response to
           a substantial change in the remote user's window of interest,
           but this decision is the responsibility of the server
           application, not the present object.
           [//]
           If a chunk has been abandoned (and `check_abandoned' is true),
           the function restores its cache model associated with all
           data-bins which contributed to the abandoned chunk, so as to
           reflect the state which they had prior to the point at which
           the `generate_increments' function was called (unless they have
           already been restored to an even more primitive state as a
           result of discovering other abandoned chunks).  This process
           may leave the cache model in a state where the number of cached
           bytes for some precinct does not correspond to a whole number
           of packets.  This is possible because packets which are larger
           than the maximum chunk size must be broken down into smaller
           messages, only some of which may belong to abandoned chunks.
           [//]
           In the event that a fatal error occurs, successful cleanup of all
           resources does not necessitate that outstanding buffers be released
           using this function.   The internal chunk server keeps track of
           all resources which it has allocated and destroys them automatically
           when `kdu_serve' is destroyed.  Note, however, that this means
           you should clean up any objects which may access `kds_chunk'
           objects before destroying the `kdu_serve' object.
