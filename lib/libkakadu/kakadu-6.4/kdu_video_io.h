Description:
   Defines classes derived from "kdu_compressed_source" and
"kdu_compressed_target" which may be used by video processing applications.
A pair of abstract base classes provide generic video management tools,
building on those of "kdu_compressed_source" and "kdu_compressed_target",
which may be implemented in a variety of ways.  A simple implementation
of these base classes is provided here for use with sequential, video
sequences, while a much more sophisticated implementation is provided
in "mj2.h" to support the Motion JPEG2000 file format.

      If you want to be able to use the "kdu_text_extractor" tool to

   implementation of "kdu_text_extractor".
      The only things you should change when these definitions are ported to
   different source files are the strings found inside the `kdu_error'
   and `kdu_warning' constructors.  These strings may be arbitrarily
   defined, as far as "kdu_text_extractor" is concerned, except that they
   must not occupy more than one line of text.
      When defining these macros in header files, be sure to undefine
   them at the end of the header.

           sequence of images opened by this function depends upon whether
           the video is interlaced or progressive, and also on any previous
           calls to `set_field_mode'.  For progressive video, the function
           opens each frame in sequence.  If the field mode was set to 0 or
           1, the function also opens each frame of an interlaced video in
           sequence, supplying only the first or second field, respectively,
           of each frame.  If the video is interlaced and the field mode was
           set to 2, the function opens each field of each frame in turn, so
           that the frame index advances only on every second call to this
           function.

           called to prepare the object for opening a subsequent image.
         [RETURNS]
           The frame index associated with the open image, or -1 if no further
           images can be opened.  Note that the frame index advances only
           once every two calls to this function, if the video is interlaced
           and the field mode (see `set_field_mode') is 2.  Note also, that
           `seek_to_frame' might be able to re-position the frame pointer
           before opening an image.
